ThinWinTen


Windows 10 Whonix Workstation

Windows 10, version 1909, build 18363.418, reduced using WinReducer EX-100 from all crappy things, so there is no telemetry and other parts of the system to spy on the user. There are also almost no basic programs provided with the system. In addition, all W10Privacy options have been implemented.

What left is

- NetFramework 3.5
- FileManager
- Powershell
- CMD

What is it for

If you are a beginner, you do not find yourself in Linux and you take the first steps in Tor, or you just want to test something safely under Windows, then download and use as much as possible. In all other cases, you should use Linux in combination with Whonix and VPN or Tails and VPN.

A good idea:
- Testing of files downloaded from the Internet/Tor network
- Sandbox for software written for Windows
- Browse pages on the Tor network
- Connecting to various types of sftp/ftp/ssh services etc.

Bad idea:
- Main system for use on the Tor network
- System for fraud and activities considered illegal

The ThinWinTen system is configured only to work with the Whonix Gateway system. Without the Whonix Gateway system running, this system cannot access the network.

Installed software

Size

ThinWinTen image for VirtualBox = 1,7 GB.
After importing, the system takes about = 4,7 GB.

Virtual machine requirements

For a good experience: 2 CPU and 4096 GB RAM (default configuration)
VirtualBox >= 6.4.1

Credentials

Username: user
Password: changeme

You should change password after first log-in to the system.

Keyboard and language

By default, the system and programs are in English, and I recommend leaving it.
However, if someone wants to change, Polish language and Polish keyboard layouts are available.

Usage

1. Install VirtualBox.
2. Download, import, run and configure the Whonix Gateway.
3. Download, import and launch ThinWinTen.
